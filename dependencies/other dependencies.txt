To compile, you'll need these libraries, besides Lua with Bitwise Operator Patch by Thierry Grellier (included):

Luabind, preferably compiled against the custom Lua library (I'm not sure this is necessary but it won't hurt.)
Pluto, a persistence library for Lua, e.g. from https://github.com/mrwonko/pluto (forked from hoelzro (64 bit patch) with added Code::Blocks project)
SFML 2.0, the Simple & Fast Multimedia Library, as available on https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML
PhysicsFS, a quake 3-style filesystem library, available on http://icculus.org/physfs/
Minizip, from zlib's contrib/ - http://zlib.net
