Class names start with a capital letter.
class Logger;

Public class members start with a capital letter, private ones are prefixed "m".
Logger::mDefaultLogger;
Event::Type;

Normal variables, parameters etc. start with lowercase.
int elapsedTime;

Headers end with .hpp, filenames start with a capital letter, in general filename = class name
Logger.hpp

Example:
class Test
{
	public:
		Test(int number);
		int Amount;
	private:
		int mSecret;
};

Make Deinit() return success since components may have to be restarted.

Output references are prefixed out_, unless it's obvious by their name.
void GetNames(std::string& out_name1, std::string& out_name2);

Hide underlying libraries, if reasonable. Ideally the user only needs to link jar-xxx.
