Some of the people who helped me:

Marcus Riemer - Tought me quite some C++ and wrote the Singleton class.
Frédéric Bellaiche - Made the "Tango-styled jar icon", available under GPL from http://www.quantum-bits.org/?page_id=3 and http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jar.svg
The authors of the libraries I used, obviously.
