load mods from /addons/ in *.pk3 & *.zip & folders
I'll need a "GTK Renaissadiant" (ZeroRadiant fork) supporting all the mod's features. Fix win32 save dialog in it.
g_allowClientSideMods to disable mods - i.e. I'll need mod reloading at run time? That could be a problem with scripts relying on things no longer available etc.?
